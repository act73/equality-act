    <h1>Equality act 2010</h1>
    <p>This act was implimented as a combination of several other acts, it acts as a cover to those with proctected atributes such as age, race, gender and disabllities. However a company can evade this easily. To begin with i will look at this with a business oriented lens, as it allows me to describe and explain better. The equality act is designed to collected and display the previous 3 acts and expand upon them, most services and businesses cannot discriminate against a person with protected qualities. The qualities are as provided: age, race, gender, disabillity, pregnancy and paternal leave, relgion/belief, marital status/civil partnership, gender reassignment, sexual orrientation. while a chuck of these wont affect the cyberspace, there are, however, several applications for each of these (because i dont want to leave you with only the online applications of the law, like the sweetheart i am). an employer cannot refuse to hire you due to any of the respective traits such as your love interest or attraction, for example: if i were to apply for the nintendo of america office and i was denided because the interviewer discovered that i liked men and thus refused to hire me simply because of that, then i could file against them for going against the equality act. or if <strong>you</strong>(heaven forbid) were harrased simply because of your gender or race, you would be protected under the equality act and could take legal action depending on how sevire the actions/harassment is. now onto the actual topic, how does the equality act affect the online world and websites/games. the equality act can affect websites, for example, a website may need a <abbr title="text to speech">TTS</abbr> for the visually unable (blind for short) or a magnifying tool (which is inbuilt into windows now) for the visually impared. now, gender reassignment and sex are irrelivent in this discussion, however they do have an application. a website cannot legally ban/refuse access to someone simple because they're male/female, and must be accessable without requiring you to be a specific gender/race, besides, people can lie on the internet so it'd be pointless anyway. the audibly unable should have subsitiles on videos.</p>
    <p>there are also a large variaty of unlisted traits that should also be known and this time do affect how a website and even the internet itself is optimized and ruled. first on our list is a simple one, that being dyslexia, websites have implimented a spell checker with most websites to optimize a dyslexic persons time on the web to be as helpful as possible, this also provides a massive <abbr title="quality of life">QoL</abbr> to the general user, as it can help catch out the odd spelling mistake</p>
